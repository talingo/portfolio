                        <p>I enjoy developing apps and videogames, I love making the imaginary become real. Passionate
                            about developing since the
                            age of 15, I had the need to better understand the world around me in a humanistic sense, so
                            I studied Psychology and
                            Humanities BA. I had the opportunity to get a professional background and a growth
                            mindset, whose guided me to
                            prioritize teamwork and honest communication. Currently I am focused on web app
                            developing with a tech stack that I
                            love and that I keep expanding.
